This Tic Tac Toe game has been built as my first project of my Web Development course at General Assembly in Sydney.

The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row, playing on a three by three game board. Players alternate placing their tokens on the game board until either someone got three in a row or all nine squares are filled.
